# Modelling_MMN

## Introduction

In the progressive field of neuroscience, our project harnesses the Brain Simulator to simulate mismatch negativity (MMN), a critical electroencephalography (EEG) component denoting the brain's automatic reaction to auditory deviations. As a tool vital for researchers and students, this code allows users to manipulate numerous parameters, providing an insightful glance into neurological functionalities and conditions. Dive into the world of neuroscience with our project, exploring neural responses and fostering a profound understanding of the brain's intricate processes.

## Installation

To run this code, you'll need the following prerequisites:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Brian2 library
- Brian2tools library
- NumPy library
- Matplotlib library

## Usage

In this code, there are three cases to test the MMN:

1. Introduction of the oddball signal.
2. Omission of one of the standard signals.
3. Changing the intervals between the standard signals.

Each of these cases requires changes in the stimuli. The stimuli for each case are commented within the code. By inserting any of them, each of these cases can be tested.

## File Descriptions

MMN_Modelling.py: This file includes the simulations for the MMN phenomena with all cases involved. It generates figures for the spike monitor of all the populations.
